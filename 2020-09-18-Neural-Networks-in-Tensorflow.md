The hands on project on **Neural Network from Scratch in TensorFlow** is divided into following tasks:

## Introduction

- Introduction to the project.
- Introduction to the Rhyme interface.
- Importing relevant libraries and helper functions.

## Initializing Neural Network

- Creating the Neural Network class.
- Understanding the init function.
- Setting up initial parameter values.

## Forward Pass

- Creating a forward pass function.

## Computing Loss and Updating Parameters

- Using the cross entropy loss with logits.
- Updating parameters for all the layers.

## Predict and Info Functions

- Understanding the pre-written info function.
- Creating a predict function with the help of the forward pass.

##  Training on Batch

- Creating the main training mechanism.
- Implementing gradient descent with automatic differentiation.

## Training on Complete Set

- Breaking down data-set in batches.
- Breaking down the training process in epochs and steps.

##  Application

- Applying the neural network model to solve a multi-class classification problem.
- Creating model instance and setting up hyperparameters.
- Training the model.

## Results

- Plotting the training results.
- A look at predictions on the test set.
